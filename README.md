## 📖 About The Project

**EcoBloom** is a beautifully crafted web application designed to make environmental awareness engaging, interactive, and visually stunning. Utilizing a modern tech stack, glassmorphism UI elements, and a soft nature-inspired color palette, the platform merges "edu-tainment" with organic minimalism.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🌸 The "Bloom" Interactive Quiz
A generative UI that evolves based on user input. As users answer eco-awareness questions, highly optimized **HTML5 Canvas** procedural flowers "grow" into the background using blending modes (like `multiply`) to create a watercolor aesthetic.

### 🍾 The "Bootle" Scrollytelling Guide
An educational journey tracking the lifecycle of plastic. We embrace the playful "bootle" typo as a core brand element. It features interactive scrolling, 3D elements, and a global, real-time "Save a Bootle" community counter. 

### 🐀 Rat-Cycle Mini-Game *(In Development)*
A kawaii, isometric 2D mini-game where a literal rat navigates the environment to collect discarded trash and sort it into the correct recycling bins.

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

As the project scales, the architecture is prepared for advanced feature integration:

* 🤖 **AI-Powered Eco-Assistant:** Implement an AI integration to dynamically generate environmental quizzes and document the lifecycle of various materials, ensuring the "Bloom" questions remain infinitely fresh.
* 🧠 **Smart Bootle Sorting:** Integrate Machine Learning models to allow users to scan objects via webcam to see if they are recyclable in their local area.
* ⚡ **Game Optimization:** Apply advanced Data Structures and Algorithms to optimize pathfinding and collision detection logic for the upcoming Rat-Cycle embedded game engine.
* 🌍 **Global WebSockets:** Transition the global "bootle" counter to a real-time WebSocket architecture backed by Redis.

---

## 🎨 Design Language & Assets

* **Color Palette:** Sage Greens (`#E8F3E8`, `#A0E8AF`), Pastel Pinks (`#FFD6E0`), Soft Yellows (`#FFEF9F`).
* **Typography:** Serif headings for elegance, clean Sans-serif for UI readability.
* **Effects:** Heavy use of `backdrop-blur` for frosted glass elements and canvas `globalCompositeOperation` for organic overlaps.
